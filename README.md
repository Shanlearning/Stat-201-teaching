## Introduction to Labs

### Pre-Labs: (5% or 30 points) 

You will be given a pre-lab assignment on My Lab and Mastering due before each lab (except for Lab 5). 

The pre-lab will post 24 hours before your lab time. Each pre-lab is worth 3 points.

Students who are not registered on Pearson MyLabandMastering will receive a zero on pre-labs.

### SAWA (Short Answer Writing Assignment):(15% or 90 points) 

For all lab sessions, you will be required to complete a series of short answer questions to be collected. Each SAWA will be completed and turned in at the lab meeting. 

The lowest SAWA grade will be dropped. If you miss a lab, then that is the lab that will be dropped. 

Students may work together in answering SAWA questions, but each student must turn in an assignment to receive credit. Lab
groups will randomized each week. 

Students who are not registered on Pearson MyLabandMastering will receive a zero on SAWA assignments. 

Lab groups will randomized each week. 

Be on time for lab. If you are late to lab and the data collection process has already begun then you will receive 20% off your SAWA grade for that lab. The SAWA questions are found in the Lab book (Statistics Play-By-Play: Laboratory Experiments for Elementary Statistics), 20% will be taken from each SAWA grade when the student does not have a copy of the lab book.

### EWA (Extended Writing Assignment):
Paper to be written on a particular lab.
You may do it for Lab 4 or Lab 8.  Recommended for Lab 4.  If you do poorly on the one for Lab 4 you may do Lab 8 as well and your higher grade will be kept.
