Found on MyStatLab under the Homework tab.
Lowest 2 are dropped.
Only open a few days before the labs.
## SAWA (Short Answer Writing Assignment):
Questions from the lab book.
Everyone must have their own lab book â€“ penalty if missing lab book more than once.
Everyone must turn in their own SAWA (even if using group answers).   
Graded by lab instructor and returned at the next lab.  
Grades found on MyStatLab.  (If grade on MyStatLab is not correct then email me and/or bring back your returned graded work).  
## EWA (Extended Writing Assignment):
Paper to be written on a particular lab.
You may do it for Lab 4 or Lab 8.  Recommended for Lab 4.  If you do poorly on the one for Lab 4 you may do Lab 8 as well and your higher grade will be kept.
More when we get closer to these labs.
