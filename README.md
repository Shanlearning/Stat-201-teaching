Pre-labs (5% or 30 points) You will be given a pre-lab assignment on My Lab and Mastering due before each lab.  The pre-lab will post at least 24 hours before your lab time. Each pre-lab is worth 5 points.  At the end of the semester the highest 6 pre-lab grades are used.  

Short Answer Writing Assignments â€“ SAWA (15% or 90 points) For all lab sessions, you will be required to complete a series of short answer questions to be collected. Each SAWA will be completed and turned in at the lab meeting. In the event that the lab runs long, the lab instructor may extend the assignment.  If you must miss a lab for a valid reason a make up may be scheduled.  Note that make up labs require a student to have accommodations made to attend another lab section.  These accommodations are not always possible.  If no accommodations can be made for a student to attend another lab section then the student will receive a zero for the lab and that can be the lab grade dropped at the end of the semester, remember you can only drop one low lab grade.. Students may work together in answering SAWA questions, but each student must turn in an assignment to receive credit. Lab groups will randomized each week. Be on time for lab.  If you are late to lab and the data collection process has already begun then you will receive 20% off your SAWA grade for that lab.  The SAWA questions are found in the Lab book (Statistics Play-By-Play: Laboratory Experiments for Elementary Statistics), 25% will be taken from each SAWA grade when the student does not have a copy of the lab book.
