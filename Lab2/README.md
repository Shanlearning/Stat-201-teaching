Example: Number of cars owned per person, Number of people attending school 

### Continuous Quantitative –

### Categorical – 

numbers that are not counts or measurements and anything that is not a number.

Example: gender, veteran status , Admission accpeted or not.

# 1. get data 
Data from : https://www.bls.gov/oes/tables.htm , I collected, cleaned and integrated these data into one excel sheet:


## 1.Make a graph for a categorical variable:
Choose sheet State_and_education_for_graph1, filter for interested areas,
### In StatCrunch:
Graph->Pie Chart->With Summary
Choose education_category for Categories in, Counts in Employment, where area_name = "National" , order by value ascending

## 2.Make a graph for a quantitative variable:
Choose sheet industry_and_edu_for_graph2, filter for interested occupation sectors,

## 3.Make a graph for two categorical variables:
Choose sheet State_and_education_for_graph1, filter for at least two interested areas,

## 4.Choose one quantitative and one categorical variable
Choose sheet Occupation_data_for_graph4, filter for interested occupation sectors

### In StatCrunch:
